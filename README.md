# Where has the code gone? 
 - If you can't find code that was previously on my profile then check this repo.

SidekickApp_MobileAndServer_Pblc was moved to - https://bitbucket.org/sidekickapp_/sidekickapp_mas_pblc/src/Develop/

MenuBot Repos were moved to - https://bitbucket.org/sidekickapp_/workspace/projects/MNBT_PBLC

Which includes the following repos:
 - MenuBotLib
 - MenuBotLib_Test
 - MenuBot_CloudAPI
 - MenuBot_WebAPI

Reason: Github does not allow changing the privacy of a repo, so I may not have a public repo with a private fork of that public repo (Bitbucket can do that).
